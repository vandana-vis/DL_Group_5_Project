This git repo consists of :
1) Project presentation slides
2) Jupyter notebook containing the model with the best results. (Final_Model_Low-head.ipynb and Final_model_PolisCenter.ipynb (with documentation of the code))
3) Saved model (please refer to saved_model_lowhead)
4) Predicting class labels for all the images in a directoy (Lowhhead_function_directory.ipynb)
